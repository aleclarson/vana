Observe your immutable state trees. ðŸŒ²ðŸ‘€

[Read the introduction.](./docs/intro.md)

## The Basics

```ts
import { o } from 'vana'

let state = o({
  /* Any data can go here */
})
```

The returned `state` is immutable _and_ observable.

Before we make any changes, let's observe our `state` object:

```ts
import { tap } from 'vana'

// This callback is called synchronously whenever `state` changes.
tap(state, newState => {
  state = newState
})
```

The first kind of mutation passes a callback to the `revise` function. Any
changes made within the callback are used to create an immutable copy of our
`state` object.

```ts
import { revise } from 'vana'

const base = state
const copy = revise(state, draft => {
  /* Mutate our immutable state in here */
})

assert(base !== copy)
assert(copy === state) // Our `state` variable is updated.
```

The `copy` object is now observed by whoever was observing the `base` object,
and revising the `base` object is now forbidden.

The second kind of mutation passes an object to the `revise` function. This is
essentially the `Object.assign` of Vana.

```ts
const copy = revise(state, {
  /* Any data can go here */
})
```

Those are the basics. Here is a sandbox you can play with:
